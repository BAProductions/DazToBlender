## Directory Structure
---
Files in this repository are organized into two distinct top-level directories - named after the applications that the files within them relate to. Within these directories are hierarchies of subdirectories that correspond to locations on the target machine. Portions of the hierarchy are consistent between the supported platforms and should be replicated exactly while others serve as placeholders for locations that vary depending on the platform of the target machine.

Placeholder directory names used in this repository are:

Name  | Windows  | macOS
------------- | ------------- | -------------
appdata_common  | Equivalent to the expanded form of the `%AppData%` environment variable.  Sub-hierarchy is common between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. | Equivalent to the `~/Library/Application Support` directory.  Sub-hierarchy is common between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
appdir_common  | The directory containing the primary executable (.exe) for the target application.  Sub-hierarchy is common between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.  | The directory containing the primary application bundle (.app) for the target application.  Sub-hierarchy is common between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
BLENDER_VERSION  | The directory named according to the version of the Blender application - see [Blender Documentation][BlenderDocsURL] - e.g., "2.80", "2.83", etc.  | Same on both platforms.

The directory structure is as follows:

- `Blender`:                  Files that pertain to the _Blender_ side of the bridge
  - `appdata_common`:         See table above
    - `Blender Foundation`:   Application data specific to the organization
**^ Note:** _this level of the hierarchy is not present on macOS_ **^**
      - `Blender`:            Application data specific to the application
        - `BLENDER_VERSION`:  See table above
          - `...`:            Remaining sub-hierarchy
- `Daz Studio`:               Files that pertain to the _Daz Studio_ side of the bridge
  - `appdir_common`:          See table above
    - `...`:                  Remaining sub-hierarchy
